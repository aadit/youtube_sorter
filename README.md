youtube_sorter
==============

In Dec 2012, YouTube made UI updates and forgot to put in the video sorting features. This Chrome extension fixes that. 

Download plugin at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-sorter-for-youtube/feamkbjehbbidedhlnlcibjoejmbjlgn?hl=en

From the Chrome Store

Description

The extension allows you to sort YouTubeâ„¢ videos by Upload Date, View Count, Average Rating, and Relevance once again.

Since December 2012, the new YouTube layout doesn't allow you to sort videos as it used it.

By installing this extension, you will once again be able to sort videos by:
     -Upload Date
     -View Counts
     -Average Rating
     -Relevance

After installing the extension, simply navigate to YouTube and search for a video. You should now see the "Sort By" options underneath the "Filter" button near the top of the results page.

Any feedback is appreciated :)

Change Log:
1.1.2 - Added https support. 
1.1.1 - Removed unnecessary permissions from the app. The app does not need to access your browsing history or tab information, nor will it ever save any of your browsing information.
1.1.0 - Added sort by "Relevance".
1.0.0 - Initial Release.
